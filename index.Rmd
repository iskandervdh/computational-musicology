Column {.sidebar data-width=400}

### Description

In this chordogram it is visible that mainly D, F and A chords are present in this piece. This matches up since it is written in D minor, but changes a lot with many accidentals. The start of the piece should contain a lot more of the actual D minor chord, but that is not visible in this chordogram. This could be because the instruments were tuned lower than `A = 440 Hz` which is quite common for orchestras playing pieces from the classical period to do. From this chord analysis it also quite visible that from around 95 to 110 seconds there is very high match for a F chord. This matches up with the part of the piece that only the orchestra is playing a lot of notes that are part of a F major chord.

### Corpus description

My corpus is a collection of multiple versions of the most common parts of a requiem mass, each by a different composer. While the texts of a requiem mass is (almost always) the same the music that composers have made based on these texts differs a lot. I was inspired to choose this as my corpus because I have sung the choir part of multiple requiem masses in the past and currently the choir I sing in is rehearsing the requiem by Mozart, which we will perform in april. Some other examples of composers that have written a requiem mass are Britten, Fauré and Duruflé, but many more versions by other composers are required to make any meaningful comparisons.

The things that are most interesting to look at are the difference in energy, valence and tempo of each requiem. This difference can be analyzed between the same part of the mass but from different composers or the difference between all the parts from the same mass by a single composer. Certain parts of requiem masses are very well known like the Dies Irae by Mozart. Which version by another composer has the most in common with a well known version of the same part and do they even sound somewhat similar at all? Is there a difference in how the texts of requiem have been put to music throughout time? These are things to look at with this collection of music.

A limitation of this corpus could be that the different versions by different composers have quite similar characteristics and can not produce any meaningful insight.


Mozart

  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(x = "Valence", y = "Energy")
```

Column {.sidebar data-width=400}
-----------------------

### Description

This image shows there is some correlation between the energy level and valence of different parts of the requiem by Mozart. This could be because the more serious or sadder parts of the requiem are slower on average and thus Spotify classifies them as less energetic. Another cause could be that Spotify can't really distinguish the difference between serious and a higher tempo and thus classifies parts with a higher tempo as having a higher valence and energy.

### Chromagram of the introitus of Mozart's Requiem

This is a chromagram that shows the magnitude of each note during the introitus of the requiem by Mozart. The first few seconds of this recording consist of only silence, which explains why there is no pitch class with a magnitude other than 0.5 in the first few seconds. You can mostly see the pitch scales that have higher magnitudes mostly correspond to the key the piece is in, which is D minor. There is also the C# pitch scale that has a higher magnitude in the beginning. This can be explained by the fact that this note appears as in the sheet music using accidentals.

### Dynamic Time Warping of two different versions of the lacrimosa of the Requiem by Mozart

This graph shows the distances between the chroma vectors in two different recordings of the lacrimosa from the Requiem by Mozart. There is some kind of blue (almost) diagonal line visible from the bottom left of the graph to the top right. This indicates that the recordings are very similar in tempo after about 110 seconds it becomes less clear where the line should be, which probably indicates that the tempos at the end of both recordings diverges somewhat.

### Description

On this page two self-similarity matrices are shown. These are from two different recordings of the Lacrimosa from the Reqiuem by Mozart. The first one is by the Berliner Philharmoniker and the Swedish Radio Choir, the second one is by the Acedemy of Ancient Music and the Choir of King's College. The sections that are visible in both of the matrices do somewhat line up, but certain sections seem longer in the second matrix.
